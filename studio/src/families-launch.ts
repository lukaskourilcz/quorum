/**
 * The launch collection: the five compositions the rotation deals from.
 *
 * Built from the 2026-08-29 viral-carousel research rather than from taste alone. Every study the
 * research walked agreed on the same anatomy — a cover that stops the scroll with one oversized
 * promise, one idea per slide behind it, a visible signal that there is more to swipe, and a
 * closing slide that asks for exactly one thing — and the founding families carried almost none
 * of it: no pager, no drawn position, no depth, a third of every canvas dead. These five encode
 * that anatomy as composition, one archetype each: the statement poster (`apex`), the numbered
 * list (`rail`), the photo cover story (`vista`), the split argument (`fault`) and the spotlight
 * (`halo`).
 *
 * They also spend the primitives the founding set never touched. A crisp mesh blob is a disc, a
 * two-stop gradient with equal offsets is a hard diagonal, `clip: "circle"` is a porthole, `glow`
 * holds a headline over art, `padText` wraps the closing ask in a card. None of that costs the
 * renderer anything new.
 *
 * The one rule that shapes everything here: a slide has exactly one string. Hierarchy inside a
 * slide is therefore drawn — numerals, discs, seams, rings — never written, which is also what
 * keeps a template unable to say anything the article did not.
