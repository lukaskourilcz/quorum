/**
 * The bilingual kit: two languages on one card, and neither of them a caption for the other.
 *
 * Its own builder rather than a `FamilySpec` in `DECK_FAMILIES`, because the deck-family contract
 * is one text slot per slide and the whole point of this venture is two. A composer there
 * receives `context.slot` and the template declares that one slot as required; a family here has
 * to declare a Czech slot and a Ukrainian one per slide and require both, so a package that lost
 * half of itself fails the render rather than drawing a card with a blank lower half.
 *
 * The slide law, in the order a reader meets it:
 *
 * - an **eyebrow** — the pillar, small and quiet, in the mono face;
 * - the **Czech line** at full size, which is the card's voice;
 * - a **hairline across 40% of the measure**, which is the whole separation device. Not a box,
 *   not a divider bar, not a flag: a rule short enough to read as punctuation. Two languages
 *   stacked with no mark between them read as one paragraph in a language nobody speaks;
 * - the **Ukrainian line** at 0.85 scale in muted ink. Smaller and lighter is a real editorial
 *   claim and worth being honest about — the feed's first audience is Czech, and the Ukrainian
 *   line is not a translation but is also not the lead. What it must never be is decoration, so
 *   it takes the same face, the same measure and the same left edge;
 * - a **footer** carrying the year·place chip and the attribution slot.
