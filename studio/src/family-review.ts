/**
 * Who looked at each layout, and at which version — stored, so "reviewed" stops being a promise.
 *
 * ## What this registry is, and what it is not
 *
 * It is a gate. `FAMILY_REVIEWS` is annotated `Record<DeckFamily, FamilyReview>`, which is the same
 * exhaustiveness trick `FAMILY_SERVES` uses: register a name in `DECK_FAMILIES` without adding a
 * record here and `pnpm typecheck` fails before the family can be dealt. A new layout therefore
 * cannot enter the library unnoticed, which is the thing the source issue asked for.
 *
 * It is not a claim that a person has looked at anything. `signOff` is `null` on every family,
 * because no per-family owner review has been recorded in this repository and inventing one would
 * be fabricating provenance. What the gate asserts today is `gated`: every automated check passes
 * for this family at every brand and offered format, its golden deck hashes what the manifest says
 * it hashes, and the record is pinned to the composed template's own version. Those are facts a
 * machine established and can re-establish.
 *
 * The owner sign-off is the inert half. It is filled by editing this file — the reviewer, the date
 * and the words they wrote, in the commit that reviewed the layout — and `signedOffFamilies`
 * answers how many exist, which is zero today. Nothing in the pipeline demands one yet, because
 * demanding one before any exists would refuse every deck; `requireSignOff` is the switch for the
 * day the owner decides it should.
