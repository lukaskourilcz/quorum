/**
 * The template family library, from `docs/design-lab/SPEC.md`.
 *
 * The five deck styles they join are one design wearing five coats: `mesh`, `aurora` and
 * `spotlight` are the same blurred-radial-blob primitive, and on MMA Files' greys — three tones
 * about 3% of luminance apart — the non-accent blobs are invisible. Only `contrast` and
 * `editorial` are structurally different from each other. A family here differs from its
 * neighbours in composition: where the photograph sits and what shape it is cut to, where the
 * type block lives, what the frame is made of. Change the palette and it is still a different
 * layout, which is the whole point.
 *
 * Three things every family carries:
 *
 * - a **rhythm**, a repeating beat pattern the body slides walk, so two adjacent slides are never
 *   the same picture with different words;
 * - real **variants**, not the empty array `articleDeckTemplate` declares — A and B differ in the
 *   accent *and* in the ground, so a queued A/B pair is two byte streams rather than two
 *   filenames of one;
 * - **per-band type ceilings**, because a cover line, a passage and a closing line are three
 *   different reading distances.
 *
 * ## One slides array, four canvases
 *
 * `carousel-template/1` holds one set of layers and four canvas declarations, so a family's
 * fractions have to hold at 1:1, 4:5, 9:16 and the Threads square at once. Every text and logo
 * frame therefore lives inside the union of the four safe areas — the story's, which is the
 * widest — and only backgrounds, photographs and full-bleed art are allowed outside it. That is
 * a real constraint and it shows: a 4:5 deck from these families is more generously margined than
 * one composed for 4:5 alone. What it buys is that every family renders honestly as a story
 * without a second composition to keep in step.
 *
 * ## Where a composer lives
 *
 * The ten originals are below. The thirteen that joined them in the 2026-08-10 expansion sit in
 * `families-poster.ts`, `families-print.ts` and `families-system.ts`, grouped by the trend each
 * draws on, and are assembled into one record here. The split is rule 8's 400-line cap:
 * twenty-three compositions in one file is a file nobody can hold in their head, and every
 * primitive they share already lives in `family-kit.ts`.
