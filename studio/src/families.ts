/**
 * The template family library: what it contains, and how one family becomes a deck.
 *
 * The five deck styles the families join are one design wearing five coats — `mesh`, `aurora` and
 * `spotlight` are the same blurred-radial-blob primitive, and on MMA Files' greys, three tones
 * about 3% of luminance apart, the non-accent blobs are invisible. Only `contrast` and
 * `editorial` are structurally different from each other. A family differs from its neighbours in
 * composition: where the photograph sits and what shape it is cut to, where the type block lives,
 * what the frame is made of. Change the palette and it is still a different layout, which is the
 * whole point.
 *
 * Three things every family carries:
 *
 * - a **rhythm**, a repeating beat pattern the body slides walk, so two adjacent slides are never
 *   the same picture with different words;
 * - real **variants**, not the empty array `articleDeckTemplate` declares — A and B differ in the
 *   accent *and* in the ground, so a queued A/B pair is two byte streams rather than two
 *   filenames of one;
 * - **per-band type ceilings**, because a cover line, a passage and a closing line are three
 *   different reading distances.
 *
 * ## One slides array, four canvases
 *
 * `carousel-template/1` holds one set of layers and four canvas declarations, so a family's
 * fractions have to hold at 1:1, 4:5, 9:16 and the Threads square at once. Every text and logo
 * frame therefore lives inside the union of the four safe areas — the story's, which is the
 * widest — and only backgrounds, photographs and full-bleed art are allowed outside it. That is
 * a real constraint and it shows: a 4:5 deck from these families is more generously margined than
 * one composed for 4:5 alone. What it buys is that every family renders honestly as a story
 * without a second composition to keep in step.
 *
 * ## Where a composer lives
 *
 * Not here. This file assembles the record and builds a deck from it; the compositions sit in
 * `families-founding.ts` (the delivery's ten) and in `families-poster.ts`, `families-print.ts`
 * and `families-system.ts` (the 2026-08-10 expansion's thirteen, grouped by the trend each draws
 * on). Every primitive they share is in `family-kit.ts`.
 *
 * The split is rule 8's 400-line cap. Twenty-three compositions and the deck builder in one file
 * is a file nobody can hold in their head, which is the cap's own stated reason: every file on
 * its named-debt list has had a bug that survived review because the reviewer could not.
