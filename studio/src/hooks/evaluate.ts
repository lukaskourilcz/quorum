   * per pack and the assigned hook renders in both EN and CS from that one assignment — a
   * language-aware gate would produce two different eligible sets for one assignment and the
   * contract could not hold. Second, Czech translations are optional in the bank and a translator
   * may legitimately open with "Z jakého důvodu" rather than "Proč"; binding eligibility to that
   * choice makes the gate a fact about the translation instead of a fact about the question. The
   * gate licenses "this asks why", which is true of the question in every language it is shown in.
   *
   * The cost is recorded honestly: `docs/hooks/04-schema-and-gates.md` asks that
   * `questionStartsWith` gates stay supplementary, so their questions must also be well served by
   * the always pool. They are — the always pool is twelve hooks.
