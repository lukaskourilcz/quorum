 * constants and would otherwise import each other in a ring. A ring of `export const` arrays is
 * not a design problem, it is a module-initialisation crash: whichever file loses the race reads
 * an uninitialised binding.

 * The five original deck designs.
 *
 * Kept, and kept resolvable: stored packs name `deck-mesh-5` through `deck-spotlight-10`, and an
 * owner override recorded before the families existed names one of these. They are one design in
 * five coats — `mesh`, `aurora` and `spotlight` are the same blurred-radial-blob primitive — which
 * is why nothing new derives them, but a recorded choice still binds.

 * name has gone unused and breaks ties on the name, and the chip row in the Lab reads top to
 * bottom off this array. Appending is safe; reordering re-deals every unpinned recipe.
