/**
 * APCA lightness contrast, alongside — never instead of — the WCAG 2.x floor.
 *
 * ## Why a second measure at all
 *
 * WCAG 2.x's 4.5:1 is a ratio of relative luminance and it is polarity-blind: it gives light type
 * on a dark ground and dark type on a light one the same number, although a reader does not see
 * them the same way. Every venture skin but two in this studio is dark, so the studio is exactly
 * the case the ratio is weakest at. APCA measures perceived lightness difference and is
 * polarity-sensitive, so it can catch a pair that clears 4.5:1 and still reads as grey on grey.
 *
 * It does not replace anything. `contrastCheck` keeps the 4.5:1 floor and keeps failing below it;
 * this check adds a second floor a pair must also clear. Two floors are strictly stricter than
 * one, which is the only direction a gate may move.
 *
 * ## Why the arithmetic is here rather than in a dependency
 *
 * The issue names `apca-w3` as the package to use after its licence is read. This repository does
 * not add npm dependencies for this work, so the algorithm is implemented here from the published
 * APCA-W3 0.1.9 (`0.98G-4g`) constant set rather than vendored. Two consequences are stated rather
 * than assumed: this file is not Myndex's code and carries none of its licence, and it is not an
 * APCA conformance implementation — it is this studio's own reading of the published constants,
 * used as an internal quality floor. Nothing here may be published as an APCA conformance claim.
 *
 * ## Why the thresholds are not the published bronze-tier numbers
 *
 * APCA's readability levels are stated in CSS reference pixels, and a template's font sizes are in
 * canvas pixels on a 1080-wide frame that a phone feed shows at roughly a third of that. Mapping
 * one to the other needs an assumed viewport, and an assumed viewport is a number nobody measured.
 * So the size rows are not used: every text and logo pair is held to one floor, `APCA_MIN_LC`,
 * chosen as the level the committed library actually clears — recorded in `docs/design-lab/TOKENS.md`
 * with the measurement that set it. A composition that reads worse than everything shipped today
 * fails; the floor rises when the library does, never the other way.

 * including each variant: 78,750 pairs — the worst measures **Lc 41.2**, and nothing falls below
 * 40. That pair is Door Money's `#ff4d3d` accent on its `#24191c` surface, which clears WCAG at
 * 5.18:1 and is exactly the kind of saturated-on-near-black pairing the ratio flatters and the
 * lightness measure does not.
 *
 * 40 is therefore the highest round level the whole library clears: it refuses a composition that
 * reads worse than anything shipped today, and fails nothing that already ships. It is
 * deliberately not APCA's published body-text level — 14% of the library's pairs sit below Lc 60
 * and 30% below Lc 75 — because a floor nothing can pass is a floor somebody deletes. Closing
 * that gap is design work on the dark skins' quiet accents, recorded as an owner item; raising
 * this number afterwards is a fix. Lowering it to admit a new layout is not, and this paragraph
 * exists to make that awkward.
