 * measured every language against one Latin sample. That is wrong in two directions at once. A
 * Cyrillic line is about eight per cent wider per character than a Latin one in the same face, so
 * a Ukrainian slot was told it fits when it does not; and a face that cannot draw a letter at all
 * renders a notdef box, which is the one rendering failure that looks deliberate.
 *
 * Both questions are answered from the same declaration: a brand says which languages it
 * publishes in, and the required alphabet and the capacity arithmetic are derived from that. A
 * thirteenth family added for a fourteenth brand inherits its gate from the brand's locales
 * rather than from a hand-maintained list of families somebody has to remember to extend.
