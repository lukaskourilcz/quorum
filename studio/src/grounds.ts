 *
 * This logic used to live inside `contrastCheck`'s closure, and it had to come out the moment a
 * second readability measure arrived. Two measures that each resolve their own grounds are two
 * answers to "what is behind this line of type", and two answers drift: the WCAG floor would be
 * measuring a panel while APCA measured the slide background, and the pair that failed would be
 * the pair nobody looked at. `validation.ts` and `contrast-apca.ts` now read this one list and
