/**
 * What the destination platform will actually accept, checked on the template rather than assumed.
 *
 * A leaf module, importing only `canvas.js` and the schema types — the same ring-avoidance rule
 * `designs.ts` and `canvas.ts` state at their own tops.
 *
 * ## Why this is a check and not a comment
 *
 * `reviewDeck` already refuses a *deck* of more than `INSTAGRAM_MAX_SLIDES` items, and the editorial
 * band in `slides.ts` is narrower again. Neither of those looks at a template. A composition enters
 * the library as a composer in `families*.ts` or as a stored `carousel-template/1` record, and
 * before this nothing asked whether the thing entering could be posted at all. So the platform fact
 * is stored here, next to the ratio arithmetic, and it is read by `validateTemplateForBrand` —
 * which `renderCarouselSvg` refuses to draw past. The library is nowhere near the ceiling
 * (`CarouselTemplateSchema` caps `slides` at 10 and `MAX_SLIDES` is 8); the point is that the
 * ceiling is now written down and enforced rather than remembered.
 *
 * ## One ratio per post
 *
 * Instagram applies one orientation to every item of a post. The studio satisfies that structurally
 * — a render names one `format` and every slide is drawn at `formats[format]` — and the `canvas`
 * check refuses a format the template never declared. What is left for this module is the shape
 * itself: a canvas whose ratio is not one the platform shows uncropped is a deck that will be
 * cropped by the feed, and nothing downstream would say so.
 *
 * ## The PDF limit in the source idea has no subject here
 *
 * The issue this module comes from lists "PDF under 100 MB and 300 pages" among the platform
 * limits. This repository produces no PDF: the deck export route emits a ZIP of PNGs, and the only
 * other mentions of the format in the tree are a prose aside and a banned-extension list. A gate on
 * a file nobody writes is a gate that can only ever pass, so it is recorded as not applicable
 * rather than written.
