/**
 * The golden render: one pinned 1080 × 1350 deck per family, hashed and committed.
 *
 * ## Why hashes and not PNGs
 *
 * The rasteriser is deterministic by construction — `rasterise()` runs resvg with
 * `loadSystemFonts: false` and an explicit list of the thirty committed faces, so the machine is
 * not part of the answer — and `tehdejsi-determinism.test.ts` already pins a literal sha256 for
 * one kit to prove it. This generalises that receipt to the shared families.
 *
 * Because the bytes are identical rather than approximately identical, a sha256 comparison is a
 * strictly stronger check than a pixel differ with an anti-aliasing tolerance, and it costs
 * nothing to store. The source issue names odiff; odiff earns its keep when two renders are only
 * meant to be *nearly* equal, which is not the case here, and it would add a per-platform native
 * binary downloaded at install to every CI run. The one thing a differ buys that a hash does not
 * is showing a human *what* moved — so the verdict carries `changedSlides`, and the CLI writes
 * those slides out to a gitignored folder for someone to open.
 *
 * The same reasoning settled an earlier question the other way: `orchestrator/src/studio/lifecycle.ts`
 * carries an explicit decision against persisting renders, because eighteen PNGs per accepted
 * template version were stored and nothing ever read them. A hash is read every run.
 *
 * ## Why the input is frozen this hard
 *
 * A golden render is only evidence if nothing about it can drift. So: no `typeScale`, no
 * `phaseSeed`, no photo treatment, no images, one brand, one canvas, one deck length, and a Czech
 * payload written out in full below rather than generated. Every one of those is an axis the
 * recipe engine varies; a baseline that varied with them would re-record itself into agreement.
